     <p>The road was viewed as one of the most used roads in Kiambu County;where it connects Ruiru and Githunguri and still links both sub-counties to Kiambu Town.
        As proposed by the county Governor Kimani Wa Matangi,the road will be re-constarcted and become a modern road.</p>
        <p>By constracting this road many farmers around the area will be able to transport their producrs to the local milk industry and also to various retail shops.</p>
